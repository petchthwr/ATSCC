ATSCC is a self-supervised time series representation for multivariate aircraft trajectory. It allows for the semantic analysis of air traffic trajectory. This repository contains the official implementation for the ATSCC framework as described in the paper titled "Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding: A Framework for Self-supervised Trajectory Representation."
